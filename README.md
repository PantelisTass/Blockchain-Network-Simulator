# Blockchain-Network-Simulator
This repository contains the code of a model for the Bitcoin network as a continuous time stochastic process. This was achieved by using tools from graph theory such as eigenvector centrality and the Dijkstra Distance algorithm. The goal is to ocmpute a parameter Î³ that is crucuial in the profitability analysis of rogue and honest minig strategies.
